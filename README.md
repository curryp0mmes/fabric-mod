# Fabric Example Mod

## Purpose

The purpose of this mod was to learn fabric development. 
Now that I know the basics, I will continue to add random stuff, maybe one day this is a proper mod with a proper purpose.

## Features

Current features are:
- crystals
- crystal shards 
- crystal ore
- crafting recipes to get from shards to crystal etc.
- crystal armor
 
This is just the start though, so be prepared for more features soon.
